# AlphaEngine
A system to data mine alpha and make money.

## Basic Structure

When you have a trading idea, it's usually something you can write in words such as: "If I take out a trade when X happens, will I make money?" There is not a good backtester or computer program to then take this, digitize it, and answer your question in a consise way. That's what the Alpha Engine is for. The goal is to take a question about a trading signal and return a decent answer which allows you to decide whether or not it is in fact a useful signal.

From there, the Alpha Engine can be automated by things like genetic algorithms that come up with the questions automatically and systems that filter only certain results based on the metrics that come out of it.

The goals of the project are:
1. Simplicity
2. Extendability
3. Speed
